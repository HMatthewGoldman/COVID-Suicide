# COVID-Suicide
School Project for Python.

For this project, I chose my own data to analyze, with the goal of conducting an
exploratory visual analysis in Python and finding connections between variables that seem
worth exploring. After developing hypotheses, I used various advanced analytical
approaches to help you test your hypotheses.
The results of the analyses will be presented in a Tableau dashboard/storyboard. Data
dashboards are an effective tool for, among other purposes, presenting data in an accessible
and tangible way. Your dashboard will tell the story of your analytical journey and, as such,
needs to contain a curation of the key results you discovered throughout this project.
Note that not all of the results will fit into the dashboard. Any additional analyses 
conducted as part of the project will need to be included in a GitHub repository.
Here is a link to the Tableau presentation:

Once sourced, the data was aggregated into 3 categories:
1. Age Groups
2. Ethnicity
3. Gender

Then, the data from the 2 primary data sources were combined to include:
1. Year
2. State
3. Variable (listed above)
4. COVID cases
5. Suicide deaths

The resulting data sets had the following dimensions:
1. Age Group 1489 x 5
2. Ethnicity 1297 X 5
3. Gender 411 x 5
